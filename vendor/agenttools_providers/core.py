"""Core of the tool-agnostic provider/model abstraction.

The public surface (``Capability``, ``ModelEntry``, ``Registry``, ``Board``,
``BoardSeat``, ``KeyCascade``, ``resolve_role``, ``failover_order``,
``load_registry``, ``ProviderError``) is re-exported from the package ``__init__``;
import from there.

What this module IS (the extracted CORE)
----------------------------------------
A *data + pure-function* layer that several tools (review-cli, task-cli's classifier,
a future research-cli) can share instead of each re-deriving model selection from its
own ad-hoc tables:

* **A provider/model registry with capability tags.** :class:`ModelEntry` is one
  concrete, provider-resolvable model id plus its provider and a frozen set of
  :class:`Capability` tags (``vision`` / ``code`` / ``reasoning`` / ``tools`` /
  ``embeddings`` / ``audio``). :class:`Registry` is the in-memory collection with the
  query helpers (by provider, by capability, by id).
* **Capability-tag filtering.** ``registry.with_capability("vision")`` returns only
  the entries that genuinely carry the tag — the load-bearing image-review filter
  (review-cli #3681): a model without real image input must never be picked to
  "verify" an image.
* **Role -> model resolution that HONORS tags.** A *role* is a symbolic lens a tool
  asks for ("architect", "reasoning", "vision", ...). :func:`resolve_role` maps it to
  a concrete :class:`ModelEntry` via the registry's ``roles`` map, and a role whose
  name is itself a capability (e.g. ``vision``) is *required* to resolve to an entry
  that carries that capability — a misconfigured ``vision: <text-only-model>`` is a
  loud :class:`ProviderError`, not a silent wrong pick.
* **A failover order.** A :class:`Board` is a *priority-ordered* list of
  :class:`BoardSeat`\\ s (strongest first). :func:`failover_order` /
  :meth:`Board.pool` give the deterministic "run the top-N reachable seats, keep the
  rest as the reserve that backfills a failed seat" ordering — the startup + mid-run
  failover review-cli's board does, distilled to its data shape (an availability
  predicate is *injected*, so this stays pure: no probing, no network).
* **A key-cascade resolver.** :class:`KeyCascade` resolves a provider API key by
  *name precedence first*: an environment variable beats every file, and among the
  files the first accepted name wins regardless of which file it sits in. The
  environment and the per-file reader are both *injected*, so resolution is a pure
  function of its inputs and tests touch neither ``os.environ`` nor the disk.

What this module is NOT (deferred — see README)
-----------------------------------------------
The *transport* half stays in the consuming tool: the network/subprocess backends, the
``oc:`` / ``opencode:`` provider routing, the ``api``|``cli`` transport-mode selection,
and every live model call. This CORE decides *which* model/seat/key to use; the tool
owns *how* to reach it. Nothing here imports a network client or shells out.

Stdlib-only at import. The one optional dependency — PyYAML, needed only to parse a
manifest *file* via :func:`load_registry` — is imported lazily inside that function, so
a tool that builds a :class:`Registry` from in-memory data never pays for it.
