"""agenttools_errors.core — one shared error/exit-code layer for every agent-tools CLI.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
    The structured-error engine. Every ecosystem CLI (review / rig / tg / draw / 3d / task)
    wants the SAME shape for a failure: a three-part message — WHAT went wrong, WHY (the root
    cause + the offending file/context), HOW to fix it (a concrete command) — and a stable,
    per-class EXIT CODE so a calling script can branch on the failure class. Instead of each
    tool hand-rolling that (rig already grew its own ``riglib/errors.py``; the others print a
    bare ``Error: failed`` and ``exit(1)``), this is the single shared copy the roadmap's
    error-system-v2 item calls for ("one shared `errors` + `help` module, consumed by
    review/rig/tg/draw/3d/task").

HOW IT'S REACHED AT RUNTIME
    A command body raises an :class:`AgentToolError` (or a subclass that pins its exit code);
    the top-level CLI handler wraps the dispatch in :func:`guard`, which renders the error as
    the consistent 3-part block and returns the stable exit code. ``did_you_mean`` and the
    removed-slot registry build *precise* errors for the "unknown item / typo / removed slot"
    family rather than a useless "unknown (known: none)".

INVARIANTS / DESIGN
    - **Stdlib only at import time** (AGENTS.md hard rule): ``dataclasses`` / ``os`` / ``sys``
      / ``shutil``. No third-party imports, so a consumer's ``--help`` / ``--version`` stays
      fast and offline.
    - **The exit-code constants are a PUBLIC CONTRACT.** Scripts/CI branch on them; changing a
      value is a breaking change. They follow the ``structured-exit-codes`` skill: 0 success,
      1 internal/unexpected, 2 invalid-usage/config, 127 missing-dependency (shell
      convention), plus the common classes a CLI wants to distinguish (drift / unknown-item /
      missing-target / not-a-repo / network / permission). They match rig's existing numbering
      (rig 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/127) so rig can adopt this module without renumbering its contract.
    - **The exit code can't drift from the message.** Each error subclass pins its
      ``exit_code``; :func:`render` formats the block; both live here, so the formatting and
      the class are always consistent.
    - **A real bug is never swallowed.** :func:`guard` only translates ``AgentToolError``; any
      other exception propagates so its traceback stays visible (an unhandled crash is exit 1,
      distinguishable from a *diagnosed* problem at >= 2).

History: generalized from ``rig-cli/riglib/errors.py`` (error-system v2), which was itself
born from two same-day prod failures whose errors were thin and undiagnosable. This module is
that pattern, lifted into the shared lib so the fix lands once for the whole ecosystem.
