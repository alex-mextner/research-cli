"""transport — the DEFERRED half of the providers abstraction, owned by this tool.

The shared ``agenttools_providers`` CORE is deliberately network-free (see its README,
"Deferred"): it orders seats and resolves keys but never reaches a model. research-cli
supplies the missing transport here:

  - an availability PREDICATE for the CORE's Board (``board.split(predicate=...)``) — "is
    this seat reachable on this machine?" (a key resolvable via the CORE key cascade);
  - a live CALL that asks a resolved model a question and returns its text.

Both are behind a tiny :class:`Transport` protocol so the panel :mod:`engine` is pure
with respect to the network: production wires :class:`SubprocessTransport`; tests inject
a deterministic fake (see ``tests/test_research_cli.py``). This is exactly the seam the
CORE's README calls "a thin transports module that imports this CORE and adds the
network".

HEAVY IMPORTS ARE LAZY (lazy-heavy-imports skill): nothing here imports ``subprocess`` /
``shutil`` at module top, so ``research --help`` / ``--version`` and the test suite stay
fast and import-clean. The live backend imports them inside the call.

    REACHABILITY reuses the shared key cascade verbatim — a seat is reachable iff its

    precedence beats file order). The CORE owns that precedence; this just asks it.

    THE LIVE CALL is intentionally a thin, swappable shell-out. A full multi-provider
    transport (the ``oc:`` router, api|cli mode selection, response parsing, sidecar
    logging) is the phased follow-up the README tracks; the MVP shells to one configurable
    command template so the panel end-to-end path is real, not mocked, when a key exists.
    The template gets ``{question}`` and ``{lens}`` and is expected to print the answer to
    stdout. With no template configured, a live call raises :class:`TransportError` (the
    seat is recorded as unreachable rather than crashing the run).

        Layered so each higher layer overrides the one below:

        1. ``os.environ`` — the BASE, so PATH/HOME/proxy survive and a backend that is a PATH
           lookup (``opencode``, ``curl``, a ``~/.cargo/bin`` tool) still resolves. The
           pre-env= call inherited this implicitly; passing an explicit ``env=`` would drop it
           unless we re-seed it here. (A curated ``self.env`` was only ever meant to govern key
           RESOLUTION for ``is_reachable``, not to strip the child's PATH.)
        2. ``self.env`` — the caller's explicit overrides on top of the inherited env.
        3. the cascade-resolved provider key, published under the provider's CANONICAL env-var
           name (``cascade.names[0]``) — the whole point of this method: ``is_reachable`` marks a
           seat reachable when the key resolves via the cascade, which includes both the alias
           names and the ``.env`` file fallback, but the child inherits an environment, not the
           cascade. A key living only in ``.env`` (never exported), OR exported only under an
           ALIAS name (e.g. ``CLAUDE_API_KEY`` rather than the canonical ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``),
           would never reach a backend that reads the canonical var — the documented setup would
           be selected and then fail at call time. So whenever the CANONICAL name is not already
           populated, we resolve the key the same way ``is_reachable`` did (any alias, or the
           ``.env`` fallback) and publish it under the canonical name. If the canonical name IS
           already set we leave it untouched — env wins over ``.env`` and over re-canonicalizing.
           Resolving against ``self.env`` (not live ``os.environ``) keeps this consistent with
           ``is_reachable``'s own reachability decision.
