"""install-skill — register the ``research`` agent skill so harnesses auto-discover it.

WHAT this does: brings ``research install-skill`` to PARITY with the sibling personal CLIs
(draw/tg/review/task), whose installers each write THREE idempotent layers — not just a
SKILL.md:

1. **SKILL.md + blurb + compat symlink.** ``~/.agents/skills/research/SKILL.md`` (Agent Skills
   standard) so Claude Code / Codex / opencode / Gemini / Cursor surface ``research`` as a
   capability, plus the one-line ``~/.agents/skills/.blurbs/research.md`` (the always-on
   advertisement a SessionStart hook cats into every session), plus a
   ``~/.claude/skills/research`` symlink (Claude Code also scans that dir).
2. **A marked block in each detected harness's instruction file.** A
   ``<!-- skill:research -->…<!-- /skill:research -->`` block is written into the instruction
   file of each harness DETECTED on this machine. The block is REPLACED on re-run (never
   duplicated); nothing else in the file is touched.
3. **An idempotent SessionStart aggregator hook** in ``~/.claude/settings.json`` that cats every
   ``.blurbs/*.md`` into each new Claude Code session.

Stdlib-only; every write is idempotent (skips an already-current target, replaces — never
duplicates — a marked block, and won't re-add an existing hook). The block/hook plumbing mirrors
the sibling installers byte-for-byte so a machine advertises ``research`` exactly where it
advertises draw/tg/review/task.

  Multi-provider research / panel CLI. Put a question to a PANEL of different models (each

  multi-model plumbing (board, failover, key cascade, capability tags) but adds research lenses
  + a panel pass. Commands: `research ask "<question>"`, `research ask --offline` (no key, stub
  transport), `research ask --json` (machine-readable), `research board` (show the resolved panel).

# research — multi-provider research / panel

You ask a question; it asks a panel of different models, each through a research lens, then
synthesizes their answers into one attributed Markdown note (deterministic, offline synthesis —
never itself a hallucination).

## Commands
```
research ask "<question>"        # single-round multi-provider panel pass + synthesis
research ask --offline "..."      # run the whole pipeline with no key (stub transport)
research ask --json "..."         # emit a machine-readable JSON object instead of the note
research board                    # show the panel resolved against the shared model manifest
research --help                   # full usage
```

## Key facts
- **Distinct from review-cli**: research lenses (broad analyst / skeptic / fast scout), not
  code-review lenses. Same providers engine, different product.
- **Reachability via the shared key cascade**: a seat is reachable iff its provider's API key
  resolves (env vars first, then `.env`). With no key for any seat, `research ask` prints an
  empty-panel note and exits `7` (the shared NETWORK class) — it never crashes.
- **Live backend (MVP)**: set `RESEARCH_BACKEND_CMD` to a shell template receiving
  `{model} {lens} {question}` that prints the answer to stdout. Without it, run `--offline`.
- **Structured exit codes** (shared agenttools-errors contract): `0` ok, `2` usage/bad manifest,
  `4` unknown command, `7` nothing reachable/answered.
