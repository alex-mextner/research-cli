"""Tests for research-cli's adoption of the shared ``agenttools_errors`` layer.

Run from the repo root::

    uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/test_research_cli_errors.py -q

These cover the CLI's USER-FACING error surface (dispatcher + the ``ask``/``board``
commands): every COMMAND-BODY failure (the tool's own diagnosed errors — unknown command,
empty question, unreachable board, malformed manifest, a broken command module) must render
the shared three-part block (WHAT / WHY / HOW-to-fix) and exit with the right
``agenttools_errors`` class code, not a bare ``print`` + an ad-hoc number.

SCOPE NOTE: argparse's OWN usage errors (an unknown/invalid flag) are deliberately left to
argparse — it prints its terse usage line and the standard exit ``2`` (``EXIT_USAGE``), the
conventional CLI behavior. The shared block covers the errors the command code raises itself,
not argparse's flag-parsing diagnostics.

Deterministic and network-free — ``ask`` runs against the stub transport (``--offline``) or
against a manifest path that doesn't exist, so no key, no subprocess, no HTTP.
