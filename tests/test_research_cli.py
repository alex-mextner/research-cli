"""Tests for research-cli — the multi-provider research/panel tool.

Run from the repo root::

    uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/test_research_cli.py -q
    # the one manifest-loading test additionally needs pyyaml; it self-skips without it:
    uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml python -m pytest tests/test_research_cli.py -q

Every test is deterministic and network-free. The transport is the network seam, so the
panel engine is driven entirely by an INJECTED StubTransport (no subprocess, no HTTP);
registries/boards are built from in-memory data so no test needs PyYAML except the single
real-manifest smoke test, which ``importorskip``s ``yaml`` exactly like the providers
suite. No sleeps, no global state.
